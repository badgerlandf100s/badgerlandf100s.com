<P>To: All F-100 truck lovers</P>
<P>From: David Kerznar</P>
<P>Hello Everyone,</P>
<P>Just passing along a few lines of text to let you all know that I am alive and well – "SORT OF". As some of you know, on March 31<SUP>st</SUP> of this year I had a heart attack and died. By the grace of GOD, the EMT’s were able bring me back to life. It seems my gender and the addition of those extra pounds were the cause of the whole thing. I had a quadruple by-pass and within 12 weeks I was back to my part time job at American Family. It seems my hours and days of work prevent me from attending the meetings and rallies and will also prevent me from attending this years’ Dash. But I was able to make up and get to Mike Connor my annual two awards – one for the Family and the John Bittners’ Non-Ford award.</P>
<P>John and I have been keeping in touch and he has me into collecting foreign and domestic license plates. I’ve been able to collect a lot of different state plates and pass a number of them on to John. He has been able to collect and trade with a European collector and both of us have a lot of them. But here is where I need your help. Please check your garage and see if you have any "close to current" plates that you don’t have a need for nor want. Also when you’re at the swap meets, if you can "dig up" any of the ones we’re looking for, please send them to me and I will make sure the John gets them. Here are the ones we have-</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;Wisconsin&#9;&#9;&#9;Minnesota&#9;&#9;&#9;North Dakota</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;South Dakota&#9;&#9;Illinois&#9;&#9;&#9;Iowa</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;Missouri&#9;&#9;&#9;Arizona (old)&#9;&#9;&#9;Texas</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;Nebraska&#9;&#9;&#9;Florida&#9;&#9;&#9;Kansas</P>
<P>Anyone that can pass along any of the missing states will be greatly appreciated. John has a special for personalized plates from any state. If you are able to pass along some to add to our collection, I would be willing to send a Netherlands’ plate back for your help.</P>
<P>That’s about if now. If you want to contact me or send me plates, I’ve included both my street and email addresses.</P>
