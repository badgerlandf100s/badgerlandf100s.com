</B><P>The adult Christmas party took place on February 7, 1998 at the Prime Quarter in Madison, Wisconsin. 26 people attended the event and many nice gifts were exchanged.

Attendees will be able to buy food and beer from the establishment. Club members can bring "munchies" and simple "finger foods" desserts. Potts Inn is located at 2450 Church St. just past the Paul Hilger's house. </P>
<P>Directions - enter Cross Plains via Hwy. #14. If approaching from the east, turn right onto Church St. and proceed to Potts Inn. Of course, an approach from a westerly direction would require a left turn.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>NEW BUSINESS:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>DASH TO DELLS 9</B> - Update </P>
<P>This year, the Club is starting the sign-up for volunteers early. Unlike past years, the Club will give everybody a chance to participate in the workings of the Club activities during our show. Lisa Watkins and Dave Farmer have volunteered to call Club members to volunteer their services during the Club's special weekend at the Dells.</P>
<P>To give everyone a better picture as to what's involved with the "behind the scenes" of show, I've listed the activities and available positions that need <U>your</U> support.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Registration <I>Chair Person - <B>Mark Favor</B> plus 4 or 5 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;Set-up registration table and man throughout Friday, and Saturday until awards &#9;presentation. Registration opens at 9:00AM both days. Three hour shifts may &#9;be appropriate. This is a center of attention position with everyone stopping &#9;to sign-in for the show. New members would also receive information from the &#9;Registration table. The Registration room has been one of the more popular &#9;areas of the show as most people will congregate for hours to talk with one &#9;another.</P>
<P>Door Prizes - <I>Chair Person - <B>Mike Sonn</B> Co-chair - <B>Theresa Sonn</B> plus 1 or 2 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;Door prizes will be delivered to this group prior to the show. Members of &#9;this group will transport the door prizes to the hotel. This group will also &#9;arrange the door prize make-up at the hotel. The Chair for this group as well &#9;as one of more of it's members will need to arrive Thursday evening to assure &#9;the door prizes are ready for distribution by 9:00 AM Friday.</P>
<P>Door Prize Table - <I>Chair Person for Door Prizes as listed above</P>
</I><P>&#9;Door prizes are awarded to those who register right after they do so. &#9;Location is the same room as Registration. Quite possibly the same people who &#9;are involved with delivering and preparing the door prizes would man the door &#9;prize&#9;table.</P>
<P>Kids Games - <I>Chair person plus 1 or 2 helpers</P>
</I><P>&#9;Prizes would be determined and purchased, as well as deciding what games &#9;should be played by the kids. The games have taken about one hour to complete.</P>
<P>Model Contest - <I>Chair person plus 1 or 2 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;This group would establish categories to judge, purchase prizes and judge &#9;entries prior to awards ceremony on Saturday.</P>
<B><P>Dash to the Dells 9</B> - cont’d.</P>
<P>Van Drivers - <I>Chair plus 3 drivers.</P>
</I><P>&#9;Van drivers would work two hour shifts, leaving the show grounds &#9;(approximately) every half hour. The route is easy to learn with only one &#9;stopping point, at the &#9;turn around. Drivers need to supply drivers license &#9;information to Chairperson prior to show, as it's needed when the Chair signs &#9;the rental agreement. </P>
<P>Selling of Club wares - <I>Chair Person <B>Randy Martin</B> plus 3 or 4 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;The selling of Club wares takes place in the Registration room and the hours &#9;of selling is the same as Registration.</P>
<P>Valve Cover Racing - <I>Operator plus 1 or 2 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;Existing track will be transported to the show by Paul Zeien. Set-up and take &#9;down is easy, just takes a few hands. Judging is fun and it's "all down hill" &#9;once the racing starts.</P>
<P>Activity Flyer for Weekend <I>1 person</P>
</I><P>Event Coordinator - <B><I>Bill Watkins</B> </P>
</I><P>&#9;Tentative ferry cruise for Friday afternoon</P>
<P>&#9;Go-carts for Friday night</P>
<P>&#9;Cruise on Saturday afternoon</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>Clean-up Crew - <I>Chair plus 3- 5 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;Clean up the parking lots at the show location and where the tent is located. &#9;Also, help clean up inside the tent. The clean-up could take as little as 15 &#9;minutes or as long as an hour. The length of time will depend on we serve the &#9;food this year.</P>
<P>Parking Coordinator - <I>Chair plus 1 or 2 people.</P>
</I><P>&#9;Directs the parking of the show trucks on the parking lot. Directs non-show &#9;vehicles to proper parking area.</P>
<P>Police/Marshall Show Parking - <I>Chair plus 1 or 2 people</P>
</I><P>&#9;This position could have the same chair and personnel as the Clean-up crew.</P>
<P>&#9;This group would walk the show while advising visitors to "look, but don't &#9;touch" the show trucks. These folks could also keep the show grounds clean &#9;throughout the day, thereby making the clean-up a lot quicker at the end of &#9;the show.</P>
<P>Trophy Chairperson - <B><I>Greg Schnieder</P>
</B></I><P>&#9;Persons interested in making trophies should let Greg know the what the &#9;intent of the trophy being made is. Greg will advise trophy makers of which &#9;trophies are being made and possibly which could be made to cover as many &#9;categories as possible.</P>
<P>Hotel Coordinator - <I>One person</P>
</I><P>&#9;This person would work closely with the Club membership and hotel management &#9;to resolve issues as they arise and disseminate information, on behalf of the &#9;club and hotel management.</P>

<B><P>The Beat Goes On...</P>
</B><P>Since I last wrote, I've been able to complete the reconstruction of the IFS on my truck. The right side of the IFS went together quite easily, after practicing on the left side. I placed my engine and tranny onto the chassis to stress the rebuilt suspension and was rewarded with a very nice and smoothly operating motion when I pushed down on the chassis. With the engine and tranny installed, the front end dropped an additional few inches. I can't wait to add the front sheet metal to get a look at the truck's "new" attitude.</P>
<P>Speaking of the front sheet metal, I started reworking the front gravel pan to accommodate my four head light set-up. The bottom lamps fit into the indentations made for the parking lights with a little metal removal. The '95 F-150 grille looks tough between the slanted head lights. One of these days, the front sheet metal will be one piece.</P>
<P>Well speaking of being in one piece, I better start cutting the tubing for the motor mount supports before the oil pan collapses under the weight of the engine. </P>
<P>More later.</P>
