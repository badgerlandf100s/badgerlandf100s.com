<P>Follow-up to the June 24<SUP>th</SUP> meeting</P>
</B>
<P>This reporter would like to report on an observation that was seen visibly at the meeting site.  I was made aware to be on the look-out for something special when I arrived at the Roelke’s homestead, and I must say, I wasn’t disappointed.  The something special I’m referring to is the reincarnation of an old blue F-1.   This truck has found it’s &quot;lid&quot; again and has been reworked into a very nice looking ride.  You need to talk with Dave Farmer on how this metamorphose came about.</P>

<P>And speaking about Dave, you should ask him or Travis Beuthin about the cruise they went on after the meeting broke-up.  You won’t believe what I heard….</P>

<P>I also heard about one of our truckers out turkey huntin’ on his way home from the meeting.  Be sure to ask Mike Sonn about his encounter with a &quot;northwoods peacock&quot;.</P>
