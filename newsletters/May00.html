</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style"><P>The May meeting was hosted by Dave Strand and John Bradley. Due to inclement weather the meeting was moved indoors to the home of John Bradley. Thanks for opening your house for us. There were 14 members &amp; Jake in attendance and 2 trucks.</P>

<B><P>Membership Report</B> - no new members this month.</P>
<B><P>Newsletter Editor</B> - Bob reported that he is up &amp; ready to start sending the newsletter via e-mail to those members who have contacted Bob. An Hewlett-Packard PC, 17" monitor and software with Microsoft Word was purchased(after rebates) for a net cost of $824.28. This included some rebates that he received. So far he has gotten 26 e-mail addresses from members, vendors, and clubs. He will start sending them this month. He will also use bcc for addresses to keep the addresses more private. </P>
<P>Jeff Burnett has donated almost a case of paper for the regular printing of the newsletter. Bob K. will check with printer to see if useable and applicable discount. Thanks Jeff!!</P>
<B><U><P>Old Business</B></U> – </P>
<P>Dave Kerznar has recently undergone quadruple by-pass surgery. We wish him a speedy recovery. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style" SIZE=4><P>Dash 11 </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style"><P>Flyers</B> - Mike Connor reported that he had some flyers made up. He gave 300 to Greg Master's to distribute and 150 handed out at Jefferson. He also mailed 300 and will take some to Pigeon Forge, Tenn. </P>
<B><P>Shirts</B> - Randy Martin was not at the meeting to make a report.</P>
<B><P>Hotel</B> - Make your reservations now before all the good rooms have been reserved. Make sure you request to be in the Badgerland area if you wish to be in the back "cove" area. Copa Cabana management has stated <U>we can reserve specific rooms</U> if we know which one we want. (See lay-out of room locations located elsewhere in this newsletter). Call the Copa Cabana at 800-364-2672 and be sure to mention the Badgerland F-100s show, September 15th-16th.</P>
<B><P>Food</B> - Nothing new to report at this time.</P>
<B><P>Dash</B> - con’t.</P>
<P>Mark Leonhard checked into purchasing a new Nesco. He is unable to get a good deal at this time. We will wait until we know for sure how many we will need for the show before purchasing one at this time.</P>
<B><P>Volunteers</B> - Mike reported that we still need someone to head up the van. Please contact Mike if you are interested in this. Otherwise things are looking pretty good. Mike will make a Volunteer spread sheet which will be in the newsletter. Please look it over and sign up for anything you will be able to help with. </P>
<B><P>Kid's Games</B> - nothing to report at this time. </P>
<P>It was brought up that since we are not having a model contest that we could up the budget for kid's games. A motion was made by Mike Connor and seconded by Floyd Johnson to up the kid's games budget from $75.00 to $100.00. The motion passed unopposed.</P>
<B><P>Friday Cruise</B> - If anyone is interested in planning a cruise for Friday please let Mike Connor know.</P>
<B><P>Dash Plaques - </B>Dash plaques would run $1.25 a piece and $ 1.00 for thank-you's. A motion was made by Mark Favor and seconded by Bob Kulinski to have 150 dash plaques made up. Motion carried unopposed. They will check on number for thank-you's before making that decision.</P>
<B><P>Club Shirts</B> - Mike Connor brought a catalogue he received from Dave Farmer. Badgerland shirts were discussed and will be brought up again at another meeting.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was brought to the attention of Todd Shower's that more than $100.00 was spent with the consent of the President, but not by vote of the club members. $400.00 was spent for printing, supplies and postage for flyers and beg letters for the show. They needed to be printed before the meeting so they could be taken to area shows. Mike Connor and Todd Showers would like to apologize for this oversight. A discussion was held by the members present and a suggestion was made to amend the By-Laws.</P>
<P>The current By-Law states(Article IV, Section H): President shall be authorized to approve expenditures not to exceed $100.00 for special expenditures, without the vote of the membership. The proposed amendment would read: Any show expense over $100.00 must be approved by the President and the majority of the club officers prior to payment. Motion was made by Todd Showers and seconded by Jeff Burnett to accept the amendment. Motion carried. A second vote will be taken at the next meeting.</P>
