<P>Club shirts also still available for $10.00. </P>

</B><P>Discussion was held on the issue of getting a web site for the club. Motion was made by Dave Farmer and seconded by Mike Sonn to go ahead and let Sean Connor set up the site. Sean will set up and take care of the maintenance of the site. The site will include club info, pictures, etc. There will be no full names or addresses of club members, only E-mail addresses.

</B><P>Mike Connor &amp; Mike Sonn have put together a list of duties for each chair for the show to aid in the planning of the show.</P>
<B><P>Dash 12</P>
</B><P>Due to the fact we could not get a show chairman, we will not be having Dash 12. </P>
<P>Instead of the show it was thought we could do some other club projects. Ideas included camping, more cruises, etc. If you have any ideas on what you would like to see the club do for projects please let one of the officers know. </P>
<P>It was brought up that the club has lost some of it's family values and maybe should try to get back to doing some group activities and not spend all of our meeting times discussing the show. We have had a very poor turn out at the meetings and we're hoping to make the meetings more fun to attend.</P>

<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>A letter from the President…</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>As some of you are already aware, DASH 12 IS ON!!! Since the last meeting, much has happened. For unknown reasons, one of our members had not received the last newsletter. He wasn’t aware that Dash 12 was in jeopardy of not happening. When he heard Dash 12 had been cancelled, Jeff Burnett didn’t hesitate to give me a call. The day Jeff called, one of his first comments to me was something to the effect that, "If it meant the show wouldn’t happen, <U>he </U>would </P>
<P>volunteer to chair the show". This was great news and I couldn’t have been happier. Dash to the Dells has become synonymous with the Badgerland F-100 Truck Club. Our show is talked about a lot, all over the country!</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">I would like to thank Jeff Burnett for coming forward and offering to be the Show Chair for Dash 12!</P>
</B><P>Well, we have a Show Chair, now it was time to scramble. With the next meeting more that a month away, a number of things had to be taken care of right away. One area of concern was getting a hotel contract signed as soon as possible to assure we’d get the rooms we want. Mike Connor and I drove up to the Dells on December 8<SUP>th</SUP> to meet with the Copa Cabana Manager. We needed a contract for September 14<SUP>th</SUP> and 15<SUP>th</SUP> 2001. A preliminary contract was worked out. Room rates are the same as last year, the big tent will cost more, but we now have 4 whirlpool suites reserved. (I would suggest if you want one of them, you better reserve one before they’re gone.) Just today (12/22), a copy of the contract was faxed to me at work. That will be signed before the next meeting so let’s get those rooms booked! </P>
<P>One item that needed to be taken care of right away was the printing of pre-registration flyers so Bob could start mailing them out before the end of the year. Bob Kulinski already has a prototype worked up and was just waiting to get the room rate and cut-off date info confirmed before printing. Since these needed to be printed before the next meeting, the Badgerland Officers have authorized Bob to spend no more than $300 getting a quantity of them printed. We don’t have artwork yet, so that will be added to future printings of the flyers.</P>
<P>The last thing I’d like to elaborate on, just a little is the need for volunteers for the various other, no less important functions. We now have the following positions filled: Show Chair - Jeff Burnett, Registration Chair/Co-Chair - Bob Kulinski/Bob Ward, Door Prize Chair - Greg Masters, T-Shirt Chair - Randy Martin and Hotel Contacts - Mike Sonn/Mike Connor. I feel I can speak for everyone in saying that we love our F-100s and we want this show to happen. Now, it’s up to the rest of us to do everything we can to make sure these guys get help. The last important function that needs to be filled is Food Chair. We’re looking for something innovative this year with food, so don’t wait for someone else, jump on the Dash 12 bandwagon! None of the remaining positions take a lot of time, but just need someone to help organize it. Help is always only a phone call away. Volunteers are the reason this show is successful. Where can YOU help out?</P>
<P>Attending meetings is a great way to stay current on what’s needed. It can also provide you the opportunity to find out where your skills can be best utilized. If volunteers come forward more quickly, it will allow more meeting time to be spent doing other Club activities throughout the year. Things like picnics, cruises, attending shows, camping trips or building trucks! <I>Together</I>, we can assure this show is a reflection of what you would like it to be.</P>
<P>A volunteer listing will be posted in most, if not all of the newsletters between now and Dash 12. We also need people to volunteer to help out with various functions AT the show. We would like to make sure there are enough volunteers so no one person needs to spend any more than two hours working a function at the Dash. That way, <I><U>everyone</I></U> will have a chance to spend the majority of the time during the weekend socializing, bench-racing and looking at trucks. That’s what our show is all about: families, friends and TRUCKS.&#9;</P>
<P>Let’s do it right!</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>Mike Sonn, President</P>
