<P>November Meeting</FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style">:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style"><P>The November meeting will take place at the home of Floyd and Rita Johnson in Chaseburg, WI.</P>
<P>Gather at Noon, eat at 12:30PM and meet at about 1:00PM. Please bring a dish to pass and a chair to sit on. Telephone number is 608-483-2594</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>.</P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT SIZE=4><P>A letter from the President…</P>
</B></U></FONT><P>As some of you already know, planning an event such as Dash to the Dells is a major undertaking. A show of this size requires almost a year of preparation in order to pull it off successfully. For the past 11 years, our show has grown at a slow but steady pace. Each year, we’ve added new names to our list of attendees. Everyone must admit we had some fun over the past 11 years!</P>
<P>But…those 11 shows were successful due largely to the efforts of a limited number of Club members. We’ve had many people offer to help once they’re <I>at</I> the show and we’ve been fortunate to have a few members come forward to chair various functions that hadn’t offered in the past. They’ve all done a great job, but for the most part, it has been the same few members, year in and year out, planning the entire show. I hesitate mentioning any names for fear of missing someone.</P>
<P>What we need this year, is for some new people to step forward and offer to take on the Show Chair and Door Prize Chair positions. It’s time consuming, but not impossible to take on one of these duties and I’m sure guidance from those with experience would be given if requested. There’s also no reason why these two functions couldn’t each be chaired by a number of people, each taking responsibility for a small piece of it. How much easier that would be???</P>
<P>One of the topics of discussion at the last Club meeting was a lack of familiarity with responsibilities of the various chairs, how to organize the show, and when tasks must be completed to assure a successful show. I have spoken with Mike Connor and we will come up with a timeline for all duties and tasks for the next newsletter. There is also a binder available that was put together by Chris Connor for each year of the Dash. That binder contains details of most everything done, including contact names for various facilities, costs, food and supplies purchased, sample flyers and other info. Mike also has lists of door prize vendors, letters, mailing labels and previous show attendee info on computer disks. This greatly simplifies sending pre-registration flyers and door prize/beg letters to vendors. All you need is a PC and a printer. Many of the tasks can be done pretty much no matter where a member may live. Here’s the blunt truth…<B>if this Club wants a Dash 12, we need a Show Chair (or Chairs) and Door Prize Chair confirmed at the November meeting. Our hotel contract has <U>NOT</U> been signed yet.</P>
</B><P>I had the opportunity this year to attend the F-100 Nationals in Pigeon Forge, TN. That show is on a totally different scale from the Dash not only in size, but atmosphere. Our show offers something different. I’d call it, small town, Midwestern atmosphere. We go out of our way to make our guests feel welcome, learn some of their names, and reacquaint ourselves with them in following years. Don’t get me wrong, the F-100 Nationals in Pigeon Forge is great. We just have the luxury of a smaller size so we can offer more personal touches. That’s what keeps people talking about our show long after it’s over. That’s what brings many of our guests back the following year. That reputation also lures new F-Series lovers looking for the experience they’ve heard about from past attendees. This show is our Club identity and it’s to our benefit to keep that going.</P>
<P>I plan to bring a copy of the position duties and associated timelines to the next meeting for review. We need your help to make the Badgerland F-100s’ show a success. If you’d like to volunteer for one of these positions, please contact one of the officers. The only real prerequisite is the ability to attend most of the meetings to provide updates and get monies approved for organizing the event.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>Mike Sonn, President</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua,Bookman Old Style"><P>October 2000 AD (After Dash)</P>
<P>It was a great weekend again. I arrived on Friday afternoon just as the cruise started and was glad to see the amount of trucks hit the road for the afternoon. I understand the cruise went well and was long enough for everyone. It was good to see the attendance remain close to that of our anniversary year (1999) and to see some new folks attend the Show. I was really happy to (finally) get my truck to the show and get that monkey off my back. Right Plowboy?</P>
<P>I hope you had a safe and trouble free drive home from the Dells on Sunday. It was a beautiful day for traveling.</P>
<P>Personally, I had to get the tow dolly I used to transport my truck to the Dash back to the rental store by 1:00PM, so I left pretty early. Well as it turns out, not early enough. I left a little later than I had planned due to all the good conversation I had gotten involved in. And then I had a little problem with the tow vehicle.</P>
<P>When I tried to restart the Dodge Ram after stopping in Cottage Grove for gas, I heard a "pop" and then no power. As I’m not familiar with the vehicle (it’s my sons’), it took me a while to ascertain all fuses were in good condition and the battery had failed. Well, during the time I was blocking two gas pumps I had a number of visitors to offer suggestions and ask questions. One couple after asking some questions about my truck, starting telling me about the restoration the husband was involved with on their ’67 Comet Caliente. Another guy in a ’65 Olds Cutlass pulled through he service station to ask me the year of my truck. A man in a ’56 El Camino, on his way to the show in Beloit, stopped for gas and was full of questions. Then another guy walked up and asked me if I wanted to buy his late ‘50s’ pickup. I learned that Cottage Grove is a friendly place.</P>
<P>It seemed like I was in the gas station for about 30 minutes blocking those two pumps, but nobody complained. I ended up taking the battery out of my ’54 and placing it into the Dodge and made it home 15 minutes before the rental store closed. Well, there wasn’t any way I was going to be able to drive my Effie off the dolly (at my home) before they closed the store, so they "punched me in" and I returned the dolly about an hour later.</P>
<P>It just goes to show you that truckin’ is a good thing! I met a lot of nice folks (at our show and on the road) and got a break on the rental. What more can a guy ask for?</P>
<P>Keep on truckin’</P>
